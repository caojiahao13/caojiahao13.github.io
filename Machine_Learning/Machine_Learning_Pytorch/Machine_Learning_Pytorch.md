I have heard a lot of things about machine learning. Here I decide to go through the book **Deep Learning with PyTorch** by Eli Stevens and Luca Antiga.

First, I finished the [official toturial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html).

* [Getting Started](./Getting_Started.html)

* [1.Introducing deep learning and the PyTorch library](./1_Introducing_deep_learning_and_the_PyTorch_library.html)
