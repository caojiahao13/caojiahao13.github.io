When I first attended my Bayesian class in 2020, I was asked to do some computation tasks using tools such as Gibbs sampler.

Gibbs sampler, for example, made me feel a little bit confused because although the result usually seems fine, I didn't find any theoretical prove to show the convergence and convergent rate of this useful algorithm.

So here I want to go through the main idea of Monte Carlo methods and hopefully answer the question that when we can use Monte Carlo and why would we do this.

The content in this section is mainly based on the book : **Monte Carlo Strategies in Scientific Computing**  by Jun S.Liu and I will mainly use **python** to do simulation.
