Want to build your own homepage like this?

Ruby + gem + jekyll + Github can help you do this with no effort.

Basically, we can use jekyll, which is based on ruby and managed by gem, to build a static web page.

#### 1.Download and install


* Visit the [official site of Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/) and find a suitable version to download.

* make sure ```Ruby```, ```RubyGems``` are installed.

* Run  ```gem install jekyll``` in command line to install jekyll.

[This document](http://jekyllcn.com/docs/installation/) is a good guide for you.

#### 2. Use jekyll
Create a new jekyll directory with name project_name:

```
jekyll new project_name
```

Run jekyll server on your own computer.

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --port <port_number>
```

#### 3. Host your site on Github

You can look for the [The offical document of Github page](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site). This document is concise and easy to read.

#### 4. jekyll theme

See [jekyll theme](./Jekyll_theme.html)
