This page is a guide to VPN tech and how to hide your identity in the internet while sending emails or searching web pages.

First, to build your own vpn, I recommend [google cloud](https://cloud.google.com/).

After creating a compute engine with http/https enabled, You can just run
```
sudo -i
bash <(curl -s -L https://git.io/v2ray.sh)
```
to build a VPN with V2ray.
